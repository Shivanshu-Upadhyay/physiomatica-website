                            Privacy Policies are agreements that specify what type of data a website collects from users and how that data will be
                            used. Known as “personal information” or “personally identifiable information,” regulated data typically includes
                            anything that can be used to identify an individual, and is not limited to a user’s name. Personal information may
                            include a user’s address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, ID issue and expiration date, financial
                            records, credit information, medical history, where one travels, and intentions to acquire goods and services, among
                            others.
                            While no single federal law requires that websites have a Privacy Policy, the sum of federal and state legislation
                            suggests that you should. Regulations vary by geographical region and jurisdiction as well as by subject matter so be
                            sure to check local laws when drafting your Policy. Privacy Policies should be updated whenever a change occurs in the
                            way a website collects or utilizes user information.
                            
                            Consider linking your Privacy Policy with your Terms of Use to ensure cohesive application of relevant laws. If you
                            would like to be more specific with your users, consider a Data Usage Policy or Data Usage Statement.

                            The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Company.
                            “You” refers to you, as a user of our Site or our Service.
                            By accessing our Site or our Service, you accept our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use (found here: [insert link to Terms
                            of Use]), and you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your Personal Information as described in
                            this Privacy Policy.
                         <br><br>
                         <h5> I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h5>
                        We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that
                        cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect,
                        referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the
                        data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email [insert specifically what personal
                        information your website collects, i.e. address, date of birth, marital status, contact information, etc.], which you
                        submit to us through the registration process at the Site.
                        <br><br>
                        <h5><em>1. Information collected via Technology</em> </h5>
                    To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the
                    Service thereafter, you [do/do not] need to submit further Personal Information [,which may include: list Personal
                    Information collected]. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us
                    by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from
                    (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the
                    time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using
                    cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our
                    servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect
                    Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both
                    on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information:
                    · [list typical things you may want to track]
                    The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your
                    session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5><em>2. Information you provide us by registering for an account</em></h5>
                    In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a subscriber to
                    the Service you will need to create a personal profile. You can create a profile by registering with the Service and
                    entering your email address, and creating a user name and a password. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect,
                    store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5><em>3. Children’s Privacy</em></h5>
                    The Site and the Service are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. The Site does not knowingly collect or solicit
                    information from anyone under the age of 13, or allow anyone under the age of 13 to sign up for the Service. In the
                    event that we learn that we have gathered personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without the consent of a
                    parent or guardian, we will delete that information as soon as possible. If you believe we have collected such
                    information, please contact us at [Company contact email address].
                     <br><br>

                    <h5>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h5>
                    
                     <h5><em>Personal Information:</em></h5>
                    Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes
                    your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are
                    performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to the
                    user's email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our
                    direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
                    <br><br>
                    In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use
                    Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support,
                    and inform users about promotional offers.
                    We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or
                    disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental
                    request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud,
                    security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public
                    as required or permitted by law.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5><em>Non-Personal Information:</em></h5>
                    In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also
                    aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy
                    does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose
                    such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.
                    In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a
                    portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that
                    such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to
                    process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time
                    in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We
                    suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.
                      <br><br>

                      <h5>III. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION</h5>

                    We implement security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Your account is protected
                    by your account password and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not disclosing your
                    password and by logging out of your account after each use. We further protect your information from potential security
                    breaches by implementing certain technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer
                    technology. However, these measures do not guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or
                    destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you
                    understand and agree to assume these risks.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>IV. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
                    You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes. When we send a promotional
                    communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe
                    instructions provided in each promotional email. You can also indicate that you do not wish to receive marketing
                    communications from us in the [list location of opt-out page, i.e. “Settings'' section] of the Site. Please note that
                    notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the [location of
                    opt-out page] of the Site, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to
                    our Privacy Policy.
                    <br><br>
                    <h5>V. LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h5>
                    As part of the Service, we may provide links to or compatibility with other websites or applications. However, we are
                    not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites or the information or content they contain. This
                    Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Site and the Service. Therefore, this Privacy
                    Policy does not apply to your use of a third party website accessed by selecting a link on our Site or via our Service.
